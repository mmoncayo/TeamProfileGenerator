Using Node.js, this CLI application will allow you to generate an HTML page with all of your team members (manager, engineers, interns), based on a user input method that will collectively organize all of the profile details related to each member.

## Installation

Use the npm install feature to establish all of the dependencies required to run the program

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
You can run the formatted tests using jest to ensure that all parameters of the code have been successfully functional to pass through


```javascript
npm run test
```

You can then begin the program on your command line by ensuring first you are on the directory and then writing out the following command

```bash
node app.js
```
